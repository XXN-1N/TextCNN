Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification
This is an implementation of the paper Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification with Pytorch, the structure in which is named as CNN-non-static.

When preparing data, we use pre-trained glove word vector for vectorization. You can download it online.
